# Metatrader4-Ichimoku-KumoBreakOut
Simple MQL4 code that opens a trade when the price gets over the top of the kumo

I write Metatrader 5 algorithm since more than 3 years and I now write Metatrader 4 algorithms.

This is why I am now trying to port my MQL5 code to MQL4.

This is a basic trading algorithm based on Ichimoku break out very basic strategy.

I don't know if this is going to make you earn money.
This is a basic code that you will have to improve and adapt with eventually other indicators, or with more criterias from the ichimoku kinko hyo indicator.

Use on demo account.

Only the M15 version (IchimokuExpertM15.mq4) contains the most recent code.
While trying to compile the first time, there will be an error because I commented the line that sends orders. For compiling properly you will have to uncomment this line (but it will trade) or remove the line and the condition that is just after it in the code.
