# Metatrader4-Ichimoku-KumoBreakOut
Simple MQL4 code that opens a trade when the price gets over the top of the kumo

I write Metatrader 5 algorithm since more than 3 years and I now write Metatrader 4 algorithms.

This is why I am now trying to port my MQL5 code to MQL4.

This is a basic trading algorithm based on Ichimoku break out very basic strategy.

I don't know if this is going to make you earn money.
This is a basic code that you will have to improve and adapt with eventually other indicators, or with more criterias from the ichimoku kinko hyo indicator.

Use on demo account.
